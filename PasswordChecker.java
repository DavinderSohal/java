// Question Three: Password Checker
// This program prompts the user to enter a password and then checks if the password entered meets all the provided
// conditions
// -----------------------------------------------------

/*
Write a program that incorporates an algorithm with a function that will check whether or not a string is in a valid
password format with the following rules:

A password must have at least ten characters.
A password consists of only letters, digits and symbol(s).
A password must contain at least two digits.
A password must contain at least one uppercase letter
A password must contain at least one special symbol

Your program should continue to prompt the user until he/she enters a valid password.
